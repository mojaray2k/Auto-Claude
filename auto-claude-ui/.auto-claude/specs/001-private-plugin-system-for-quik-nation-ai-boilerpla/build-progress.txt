=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Auto Claude UI - Private Plugin System
Workspace: Managed by Python orchestrator
Started: 2024-12-21

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Greenfield plugin architecture implementation. This adds new plugin management capabilities to Auto Claude without modifying core task execution logic. The feature is self-contained with clear boundaries, integrates with existing app startup, settings UI, and task creation flows, and has explicit acceptance criteria.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 8
- Total subtasks: 33
- Created init.sh
- Analyzed codebase patterns and structure

Phase Summary:

Phase 1 - Foundation: Types & Plugin Manager (4 subtasks)
  - Create TypeScript plugin type definitions
  - Implement PluginManager core class in main process
  - Create Zustand plugin store for renderer state
  - Initialize PluginManager on app startup
  - Dependencies: None (foundation phase)
  - Status: pending

Phase 2 - GitHub Integration (4 subtasks)
  - Install simple-git and octokit dependencies
  - Create GitHubAuth service with PAT authentication
  - Create IPC handlers for plugin operations
  - Add electronAPI types for plugin methods
  - Dependencies: phase-1-foundation
  - Status: pending

Phase 3 - Settings UI - Plugins Tab (2 subtasks)
  - Create PluginsPanel component for settings
  - Add 'Plugins' tab to AppSettingsDialog
  - Dependencies: phase-1-foundation
  - Status: pending

Phase 4 - Install Plugin Dialog (4 subtasks)
  - Create InstallPluginDialog component with GitHub mode
  - Add local path mode to InstallPluginDialog
  - Integrate InstallPluginDialog with PluginsPanel
  - Implement plugin install flow with progress tracking
  - Dependencies: phase-2-github-integration
  - Status: pending

Phase 5 - Boilerplate Project Detection (3 subtasks)
  - Implement boilerplate project detection logic
  - Create BoilerplateTab component for project settings
  - Add Boilerplate tab to ProjectSettings
  - Dependencies: phase-1-foundation
  - Status: pending

Phase 6 - Task Context Injection (3 subtasks)
  - Create usePluginContext hook
  - Integrate plugin context into task creation flow
  - Add user preference toggle for context injection
  - Dependencies: phase-5-boilerplate-detection
  - Status: pending

Phase 7 - Update Engine & Conflict Detection (4 subtasks)
  - Create UpdateEngine with conflict detection logic
  - Create UpdatePluginDialog with category view
  - Implement update preview and diff view
  - Implement safe update application with backup
  - Dependencies: phase-2-github-integration
  - Status: pending

Phase 8 - Testing & QA (6 subtasks)
  - Write unit tests for PluginManager
  - Write unit tests for GitHubAuth
  - Write unit tests for UpdateEngine
  - Write integration tests for plugin install flow
  - Write E2E test for complete plugin workflow
  - Run security scan and validate token handling
  - Dependencies: phase-4-install-dialog, phase-6-context-injection, phase-7-update-engine
  - Status: pending

Services Involved:
- main: Electron + React + TypeScript frontend/desktop application
  - Tech: React, TypeScript, Vite, Electron, Zustand, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS
  - Port: 3000 (dev server)
  - Package Manager: pnpm

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Recommended workers: 1 (sequential execution recommended due to dependencies)
- Parallel groups:
  * phase-3-settings-ui and phase-5-boilerplate-detection (both depend only on phase-1-foundation, different file sets)

Key Technical Decisions:
- Use simple-git for Git operations (main process only)
- Use octokit for GitHub API metadata/validation
- Use Electron IPC for renderer ↔ main communication
- Store GitHub PAT using Electron safeStorage API (secure)
- Plugin directory: ~/.auto-claude/plugins/
- Selective update mechanism (NOT git submodules)
- Preserve user customizations during updates

New Dependencies Required:
- simple-git (Git operations in main process)
- octokit (GitHub API for private repos)
- @types/simple-git (dev dependency)

Verification Strategy:
- Risk Level: HIGH (plugin system with dynamic loading and GitHub auth)
- Test Types: Unit, Integration, E2E
- Security Scanning: Required (token storage, credential exposure)
- Key Acceptance Criteria:
  * Plugin manager loads on app startup without blocking
  * Settings shows Plugins tab with installed plugins list
  * Install dialog works with GitHub URLs and local paths
  * GitHub authentication works with PAT for private repos
  * Boilerplate projects auto-detected when added
  * Project settings shows Boilerplate tab with 38 skills
  * Task creation context includes boilerplate skills automatically
  * Update UI displays categories with conflict detection
  * Updates can be previewed (diff view) before applying
  * Updates can be applied safely with rollback capability
  * All tests pass (unit, integration, e2e)
  * Security verification complete (no token exposure)

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  cd /Users/amenra/Auto-Claude/auto-claude-ui/.auto-claude/specs/001-private-plugin-system-for-quik-nation-ai-boilerpla
